As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. You have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.

The following tasks were completed:
a. The data was checked for any mouse ID with duplicate time points and any data associated with that mouse ID was removed.

b. A summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen was generated.

c. A bar plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen throughout the course of the study was generated.

d. A pie plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study was generated.

e. The final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin were calculated. The quartiles and IQR were calculated and quantitatively determined if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.

f. A box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style was generated Using Matplotlib.

g. A mouse that was treated with Capomulin was selected and a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for that mouse was generated.

h. A scatter plot of tumor volume versus mouse weight for the Capomulin treatment regimen was generated.

i. The correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment was calculated. The linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot was plotted.

j. Three observations or inferences that can be made from the data are included at the top of notebook.
